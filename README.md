# 🧮 **Tiny Calculator Friend** 🤖  

**Hello little explorer!** 👶  
This is a **magic number machine** (called a "calculator") made with Python!  

---

## 🌟 **What Does This Code Do?**  

1. **It asks you for two numbers** 🔢  
   - *Example:* `5` and `3`  
2. **It asks what math trick you want** ➕➖✖️➗  
   - *Example:* `+` (for adding)  
3. **It does the math and gives you the answer!** 🎉  
   - *Example:* `5 + 3 = 8`  

---

## 🎨 **How Does It Work? (For Tiny Brains!)**  

- **`num1`** = First number you type  
- **`num2`** = Second number you type  
- **`operator`** = The math trick (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
- **`if` / `elif`** = The code's way of *"thinking"* 🤔  

### Example:  
```python
if operator == '+':  
    result = num1 + num2  # ➕ Makes numbers hug and combine!
```

## 🚀 **Try It Yourself!**  

1. **Run the code** (Ask a grown-up if you need help!)  
2. **Type two numbers** (Like `10` and `2`)  
3. **Pick an operator** (Like `*` for multiplication)  
4. **See the magic answer!** ✨  

**Example Play:**  
```
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 2  
Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): *  
10 * 2 = 20  🎉 (Woah! Big number!)  
```
